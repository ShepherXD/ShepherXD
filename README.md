Hi. I'm a Software Engineer based in Tokyo, Japan. I recently graduated with a Master's degree in Computer Science from a University in Japan.
My previous development work has primarily focused on **Web development** and **AI** technologies (such as NLP and LLM)

## Recent Projects

### 1. Cat Album (Web APP)
**Full-stack development | AI Integration | Cloud Deployment**   
[**View Project Repository**](https://github.com/ShepherXD/cat-album) | [**View Live Demo**](https://cat-album.shepherxd.net)

This is a web application that allows users to upload and manage cat photos. I integrated LLM to automatically analyze the image and identify the cat breed.

* **Goal:** To solve a real-life need for organizing pet photos with intelligent tagging.
* **Key Features:** **AI-based classification on cat breeds** from uploaded images, powered by **prompt engineered LLM** calling.

### 2. Text Detoxification using Diffusion Models (Research)   
**NLP Research | Deep Learning | Master's Thesis**   
[**View Project Repository**](https://github.com/ShepherXD/master-thesis)

This repository contains the implementation code for my Master's Thesis. We researched a new method to remove toxic content from text while preserving the original meaning.

* **Problem:** Large Language Models often generate toxic or biased content.
* **Solution:** I utilized **Diffusion Models** for text generation instead of standard autoregressive models. This approach improves the diversity of the generated text.
* **Engineering:**
    * Designed a multi-stage **Transfer Learning** pipeline (Pre-training on QQP, Fine-tuning on ParaDetox).
    * Implemented a **BERT-based Encoder** to guide the diffusion process toward non-toxic results.
    * Developed a custom **Joint Score** metric to evaluate semantic preservation and toxicity reduction simultaneously.
